        <title>Overloading Method Parameters</title>
    

<p>What if the programmer wanted to develop a method that could take more than one type of argument? You may have noticed in the past that the <c>abs</c> method in the <c>Math</c> class works with either <c>int</c> values or <c>double</c> values. That is because there are two different implementations of this method, one for each of these parameter data types. This is called <term>overloading</term>.
</p>
    <p>
Methods in Java are not identified by their name alone. If you were to call <c>Math.abs(5)</c>, the Java compiler will search for a method named <c>abs</c> that has exactly one parameter of type <c>int</c> to bind this call to. There may be another method named <c>abs</c> that has a parameter of type <c>double</c>, or more than one parameter, or no parameters, etc..
    </p>

    <example>

        <p>Consider the following method definitions:</p>

<program language="java"><input>
int abs(int a) {
  System.out.println("abs was called with an int");
  return a > 0 ? a : -a;
}

double abs(double a) {
  System.out.println("abs was called with an double");
  return a > 0 ? a : -a;
}
</input></program>

<p>The implementations of these methods look nearly identical, but if you enter them in to jshell and then evaluate the following statements:
</p>
<program language="java"><input>
abs(-5);
abs(-5.0);
</input></program>

<p>You will see that one returns an integer value and the other returns a double value, as well as each printing out a different message.
