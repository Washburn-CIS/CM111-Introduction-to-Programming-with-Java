This book is a composite built from editing and combining two other open-source textbooks: "JavaJavaJava" and "CS1 in Java". 
The latter was roughly a collection of notes developed for teaching introductory programming from the smallest elements of the Java 
language and leveraging a REPL (Jshell) to do so and developed by Joseph Kendall-Morwick. The source for this text can be found here:
<url href="https://github.com/jmorwick/cs1-java-book" visual="">https://github.com/jmorwick/cs1-java-book</url>. 
Further extensions of it for Washburn (prior to the development of this runestone textbook) can also be found here:

<p>Most of this textbook is a fork (forked December 18th, 2025) of an open textbook called "JavaJavaJava". Elements from "CM111-Intro-to-Java" 
have been sprinkled in throughout, other edits have been made, and the order of topics has been redeveloped, but otherwise this text 
is derived from the work of the authors below. I have also left their preface intact (starting with the next paragraph).</p>

Java, Java, Java first edition (2000) and second edition (2003) were published by
Prentice-Hall, and the third edition (2006) by Pearson Education, Inc. 
In 2010 Pearson Education, Inc. reassigned the copyright to
the authors, Ralph Morelli and Ralph Walde. The authors made the 4th edition book PDF available
under an open source license in 2016. In 2017, David G. Cooper (West Chester University) 
contributed changes to replace applets with java.awt.Canvas code for graphics.</p>
<p>In 2022, authors Ralph Morelli (Trinity College, emeritus), 
Ralph Walde (Trinity College, emeritus), joined by 
Beryl Hoffman (Elms College), created the first 
interactive e-book edition of Java, Java, Java on Runestone. Doug Lundin (Arapahoe Community College) 
helped review some of the book's graphical interfaces. In 2024, David
G. Cooper converted the end of chapter exercises to be interactive and
converted the optional graphics sections to work in ActiveCode instead
of on repl.it. This edition is dedicated to the memory of Ralph Morelli, a great CS educator and friend who passed away in 2023.
