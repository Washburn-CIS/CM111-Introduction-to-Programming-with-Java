    <title>Basic Class Definitions</title>

    <p>Every object type has a class definition associated with it, but classes in Java are also used for other special purposes, such as creating a collection of static methods (for example, the Math class) or for creating a Java application. Classes are the primary definition you'll find in a typical Java source-code file. These files end with the extension .java (rather than .txt or .jsh). 
    </p>
    <subsection>
        <title>Class and Static Method Definition Syntax</title>
        <p>A class definition begins with the keyword <c>class</c>, followed by the class name, and then a pair of curly braces. For example, here is a very simple class definition:
        </p>
<program language="java"><input>
class ExampleClass {
}
</input></program>
        <p>A Java file must contain one class designated as public using the <c>public</c> keyword before the class definition. It's also important to note that the filename must match the name of the public class, with <em>.java</em> at the end (similar to how an HTML file has <em>.html</em> at the end). For example, if we were to produce a Java file called <em>ExampleClass.java</em>, it could have the following as its contents:
        </p>

        <program language="java"><input>
public class ExampleClass {
}</input></program>
        <p>Inside of these curly braces is the class body in which its <term>members</term> are defined. Class members include method definitions, so we can include any of the method definitions we've been developing. If we make these methods static by including the <c>static</c> keyword before the method definition, we can use them like any other static method (such as <c>max</c> in the <c>Math</c> class). For instance, consider the following modification of the class definition above:
        </p>
      <program language="java"><input>
public class ExampleClassWithStaticMethod {
  static void sayHello() {
    System.out.println("Hello!");
  }
} 
</input></program>
        <p>Any other Java code we write, even in another file, could access this method as follows:
        </p>
<program language="java"><input>
ExampleClassWithStaticMethod.sayHello();
</input></program>
  <p>And in JShell, we could first use an import and then omit the class name when calling the method:
  </p>
<program language="java"><input>
import static ExampleClassWithStaticMethod.sayHello;
sayHello();
</input></program>
<p>If we want to use import statements in a Java file, they must all come before the class definitions (unlike JShell, where we could use import statements at any time). For example, if we want to use the <c>min</c> from the <c>Math</c> class in a method inside a class we define, we could import it at the top of the file:
</p>
<program language="java"><input>
import static java.lang.Math.min;

public class ExampleClassWithImport {
  public int getValidGrade(int rawGrade) {
    return min(100, rawGrade);
  }
}
</input></program>
    </subsection>
    <subsection>
        <title>Static Fields</title>
        <p>Methods aren't the only members we can add to a class. Variables can also be members, in which case they are called <term>fields</term>. For example, we can create a variable called <c>greeting</c> to hold the message we use in the <c>sayHello</c> method. This allows us to more easily maintain consistency with other methods that greet the user in other ways. <c>greeting</c> must also be declared static to be used as a general purpose method:
        </p>
        <program language="java"><input>
public class ClassWithMultipleStaticMethods {
  static String greeting = "Hello!";

  static void sayHello() {
    System.out.println(greeting);
  }

  static void sayHelloEmphatically() {
    System.out.println(greeting + "!!!!!!!!");
  }
}
</input></program>
    </subsection>
    
    
    
    <subsection xml:id="scope">

        <title>Scope</title>

    <p>
      When writing larger programs, you will find that some variable definitions will only work as you expect them to in some parts of the program. This is because variable definitions are bound to a <term>scope</term> within the program. </p>

    <p>
      In Java, variable scopes are limited to the code blocks they're defined in. The extent of a code block is everything in between the block's opening and closing curly braces. Once a variable is defined inside the scope of a code block, it can be referenced on any succeeding line, including those in nested code blocks (additional code blocks defined inside of the code block in question).
    </p>


    <example  xml:id="basic-scope"
        >
        <title>Basic Scope Example</title>
        <p>Considering the following code:
<program language="java"><input>
{
  var x = 5;
  {
    var y = x + 5;
  }
  System.out.println(x);
  System.out.println(y);  // error, y is not defined in this scope
}
System.out.println(x);  // error, x is not defined in this scope
</input></program>

      Both of the commented-out print statements would be errors since the variables they reference are defined in a different scope. Note that the first print statement is valid because <c>x</c> is defined in the same scope as that statement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another important thing to note is that the statement in the inner-most scope can legally access the variable x. If a block of code is opened inside another block of code, it will inherit all the variable definitions of its enclosing scope.
        </p>
    </example>


    <p>
      Blocks of code comprising the bodies of conditional statements, loops, and method definitions. Variables defined in the header of a for loop are constrained to the scope of the body of the for loop.
    </p>


    <example  xml:id="for-loop-error">
        <title>Common Scope Error with For Loops</title>
        <p>Considering the following code:
<program language="java"><input>
for(int x = 1; x &lt;= 10; x = x + 1);
    System.out.println(x);
</input></program>

      At first glance, it appears this code will print out the numbers <c>1</c> through <c>10</c>, however, there is a semi-colon at the end of the first line. When omitting curly braces, the body of a for loop will consist of a statement immediately following the loop header. Since a semicolon follows the loop header, it counts as the single statement, meaning the print statement on the second line is not part of the for loop's body. Thus, the reference to the variable <c>x</c> is not in the correct scope and will be caught as a syntax error.
        </p>
    </example>
</subsection>
    
    
    <subsection>
        <title>Scope of Fields</title>
        <p>Note that the variable <c>greeting</c> in the previous example is accessible in both of the static methods in the class. That is because the <term>scope</term> of the variable is the entire class definition body. Note that unlike other scope-limited variables, we can access the static scope of a class by giving the class name and following it with the dot operator:

<program language="java"><input>
ClassWithMultipleStaticMethods.sayHello();
ClassWithMultipleStaticMethods.sayHelloEmphatically();
</input></program>
        </p>

        <subsubsection>
            <title>Constants</title>
            <p>Because <c>greeting</c> is a member of the class, just like the <c>sayHello</c> method, it can be accessed from outside of the class as well. That means that the greeting could be modified from outside the class, such as in the following example:
            </p>

<program language="java"><input>
ClassWithMultipleStaticMethods.greeting = "Hey Jerk";
</input></program>

            <p>If a field is never meant to be altered, it should be made in to a <term>constant</term> by using the <c>final</c> keyword in its definition. Here is the updated definition of the running example that prevents any changes to the greeting field:
            </p>

          <program language="java"><input>
public class ClassWithMultipleStaticMethods {
  static final String greeting = "Hello!";

  static void sayHello() {
    System.out.println(greeting);
  }

  static void sayHelloEmphatically() {
    System.out.println(greeting + "!!!!!!!!");
  }
}
</input></program>
