<title>Declaring an Instance Variable</title>
<p>
	  There are generally two kinds of elements declared and defined in the class body:
	  variables and methods.
	  An <term>instance variable</term> is a variable that belongs to each object,
	  or instance, of the class.
	  That is, each instance of a class has its own copies of the class's instance variables.
	  The <c>HelloWorld</c> class has a single instance variable, (<c>greeting</c>), which is declared as follows:
</p>
<program language="java"><input>
    private String greeting = "Hello, World!";
</input></program>
<p>
      In general, an instance variable declaration has the following syntax,
      some parts of which are optional:
</p>
<c>
        [Modifiers] Type VariableName [InitializerExpression]
</c>
<p>
      In declaring the <c>greeting</c> variable,
      we use the optional access modifier, <c>private</c>, to declare that <c>greeting</c> can only be
      accessed in the <c>HelloWorld</c> class; it cannot be directly accessed by other objects.
</p>
<p>
      The next part of the declaration is the variable's type (<c>String</c>), which means that it can store a string object.
      The type is followed by the name of the variable (<c>greeting</c>), which can be used 
      throughout the <c>HelloWorld</c> class. For example, notice that <c>greeting</c> is used on line 11 
      in a <c>println()</c> statement.
</p>
<p>
      The last part of the declaration is an optional initializer expression.
      In this example, we use it to assign an initial value,
<q>Hello, World!,</q>
      to the <c>greeting</c> variable.
</p>

<title>Defining an Instance Method</title>
<p>
      Recall that a <term>method</term> is a named section of code that can be called or invoked to carry out an action or operation.
      In a Java class,
      the methods correspond to the object's behaviors or actions.
      The <c>HelloWorld</c> program has two method definitions:
      the <c>greet()</c> method and the <c>main()</c> method.
</p>
<p>
      A method definition consists of two parts:
      the method header and the method body.
      In general, a method header takes the following form,
      including some parts which are optional:
</p>
<c>
        [Modifiers] ReturnType MethodName ([ParameterList])
</c>
<p>
      As with a variable declaration,
      a method definition begins with optional modifiers.
      For example,
      the definition of the <c>greet()</c> method on line 9 uses the access modifier, <c>public</c>, to 
      declare that this method can be accessed or referred to by other classes.
</p>
<p>
      The next part of the method header is the method's return type.
      This is the type of value, if any, that the method returns.
      Both of the methods in <c>HelloWorld</c> have a return type of <c>void</c>. This means that they don't return anything.
      Void methods just execute the sequence of statements given in their bodies. We'll see examples of methods that return
      values in the next chapter.
<!--
      For an example of a method that does return a value,
      take a look again at the declaration of the <c>getQuestion()</c> method in the <c>Riddle</c> class,
      which returns a <c>String</c>(
      <xref ref="fig_riddleclass"></xref>).
-->
</p>
<p>
      The method's name follows the method's return type.
      This is the name that is used when the method is called.
      For example,
      the <c>greet()</c> method is called on line 17.
</p>
<p>
      Following the method's name is the method's parameter list.
      A <em>parameter</em> is a variable that temporarily stores data values that are being passed to the method when the method is called.
      Some methods,
      such as the <c>greet()</c> method,
      do not have parameters, because they are not passed any information.
</p>
<p>
      The last part of method definition is its body,
      which contains a sequence of executable statements.
      An <term>executable statement</term>
      is a Java statement that takes some kind of action when the program is run.
      For example,
      the statement in the <c>greet()</c> method,
</p>
<program language="java"><input>
    System.out.println(greeting);   //  Output statement
</input></program>
<p>
      prints a greeting on the console.
</p>
