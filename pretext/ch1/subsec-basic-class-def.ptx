<title>Class Definition</title>
<p>
      A Java program consists of one or more class definitions.
      In the <c>HelloWorld</c> example,
      we are defining the <c>HelloWorld</c> class,
      but there are also three predefined classes involved in the program.
      These are the <c>Object</c>,<c>String</c>, and <c>System</c> classes all of which are defined in the Java class library.
      Predefined classes, such as these,
      can be used in any program.
</p>
<p>
      As the <c>HelloWorld</c> program's comments indicate,
      a class definition 
      has two parts:
      a <em>class header</em> and a <em>class body</em>.
      In general, a class header takes the following form,
      where the parts marked <m>_{opt}</m> are  optional.
</p>
<definition>
<title>Class header</title>
<p>
      The class header takes the form:<p>
      ClassModifiers<m>_{opt}</m> <c>class</c> ClassName Pedigree<m>_{opt}</m>
      </p>
</p>

</definition>
<p>
      The class header for the <c>HelloWorld</c> class is:
</p>
<program language="java"><input>
	public class HelloWorld extends Object
</input></program>
<p>
	  The purpose of the header is to give the class its name (<c>HelloWorld</c>), identify its 
	  accessibility (<c>public</c> as opposed to <c>private</c>), and describe where it fits into the Java class hierarchy
	  (as an extension of the <c>Object</c> class).
</p>
<p>
	  In this case,
	  the header begins with the optional access modifier, <c>public</c>, which 
	  declares that this class can be accessed by any other classes.
	  The next part of the declaration identifies the name of the class, <c>HelloWorld</c>. 
	  And the last part declares that <c>HelloWorld</c> is a subclass of the <c>Object</c> class.
	  We call this part of the definition the class's pedigree.
</p>
<p>
	  The <c>Object</c> class is the top class of the entire Java hierarchy.
	  By declaring that <c>HelloWorld extends Object</c>, we are saying that 
<c>HelloWorld</c> is a direct <em>subclass</em>
	  of <c>Object</c>. In fact,
	  it is not necessary to declare explicitly that <c>HelloWorld</c> extends <c>Object</c> because that is Java's default assumption.
	  That is, if you omit the extends clause in the class header, Java will automatically assume that the class is a subclass of <c>Object</c>.
</p>
<p>
	  The class's body,
	  which is enclosed within curly brackets, { and }, 
	  contains the declaration and definition of the elements that make up the objects of the class.
	  This is where the object's attributes and actions are defined.
