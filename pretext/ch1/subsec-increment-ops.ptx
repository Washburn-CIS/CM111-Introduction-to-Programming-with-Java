    <title>Increment and Decrement Operators</title>
    <p>
      Java provides a number of unary operators that are used to increment or decrement an integer variable.
      For example, the expression <em>k++</em>
      uses the <em>increment operator</em>
          <idx><h>increment operator ++</h></idx>
      <em>++</em> to increment the value of the integer variable <em>k</em>.
      The expression <em>k++</em> is equivalent to the following Java statements:
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
int k;
k = k + 1;// Add 1 to k and assign the result back to k
 </input></program>
    <p>
      The unary <em>++</em> operator applies to a single integer operand,
      in this case to the variable <em>k</em>.
      It increments <em>k</em>'s value by 1 and assigns the result back to <em>k</em>.
      It may be used either as a <em>preincrement</em>
          <idx><h>preincrement</h></idx>
      or a <em>postincrement
          <idx><h>postincrement</h></idx>
      </em> operator.
      In the expression <em>k++</em>,
      the operator <em>follows</em> the operand,
      indicating that it is being used as a
      <em>postincrement</em> operator.
      This means that the increment operation is done <em>after</em>
      the operand's value is used.
    </p>
    <p>
      Contrast that with the expression
      <em>++k</em> in which the <em>++</em>
      operator <em>precedes</em> its operand.
      In this case, it is used as a <em>preincrement</em> operator,
      which means that the increment operation is done <em>before</em>
      the operand's value is used.
    </p>
    <p>
      When used in isolation, there is no practical difference between
      <em>k++</em> and <em>++k</em>.
      Both are equivalent to <em>k = k + 1</em>.
      However, when used in conjunction with other operators,
      there is a significant difference between preincrement and postincrement.
      For example, in the following code segment,
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
int j = 0, k = 0;   // Initially both j and k are 0
j = ++k;            // Final values of both j and k are 1
 </input></program>
    <p>
      the variable <em>k</em> is incremented <em>before</em>
       its value is assigned to <em>j</em>.
      After execution of the assignment statement,
      <em>j</em> will equal 1 and <em>k</em> will equal 1.
      The sequence is equivalent to
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
int j = 0, k = 0;   // Initially both j and k are 0
k = k + 1;
j = k;              // Final values of both j and k are 1
 </input></program>
    <p>
      However, in the following example,
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
int i = 0, k = 0; // Initially both i and k are 0
i = k++;          // Final value of i is 0 and k is 1
 </input></program>
    <p>
      the variable <em>k</em> is incremented <em>after</em>
      its value is assigned to <em>i</em>.
      After execution of the assignment statement,
      <em>i</em> will have the value 0 and
      <em>k</em> will have the value 1.
      The preceding sequence is equivalent to
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
int i = 0, k = 0;   // Initially both i and k are 0
i = k;
k = k + 1;          // Final value of i is 0 and k is 1
 </input></program>
    <p>
      In addition to the increment operator, Java also supplies the
      <em> decrement<idx><h>decrement operator <ndash/></h></idx>
      </em> operator <em><m>--</m></em>,
      which can also be used in the predecrement
          <idx><h>predecrement</h></idx>
      and postdecrement
          <idx><h>postdecrement</h></idx>
      forms.
      The expression <em><m>--</m> k</em>
      will first decrement <em>k</em>'s value by 1 and then use <em>k</em>
      in any expression in which it is embedded.
      The expression <em>k<m>--</m></em>
      will use the current value of
      <em>k</em> in the expression in which <em>k</em>
      is contained and then it will decrement
      <em>k</em>'s value by 1.

      <xref ref="tab-incrdecr">Table</xref> summarizes the increment and decrement operators.
      The unary increment and decrement operators have higher precedence than 
      any of the binary arithmetic operators.

      <p>
        Because of their subtle behavior,
        be careful in how you use the unary increment and decrement operators.
        They are most appropriate and useful for incrementing and decrementing loop variables,
        as we'll see later.
