      The more bits a data type has,
      the more values it can represent.
      One bit can represent two possible values, 1 and 0, which can be used to stand for true and false,
      respectively.
      Two bits can represent four possible values: 00, 01, 10, and 11;
      three bits can represent eight possible values: 000, 001, 010, 100, 101, 110, 011, 111.
    </p>
    <p>
    <definition>
      An <em>n</em>-bit quantity can represent <m>2^n</m> different values.
    </definition>
    </p>
    <p>
      As illustrated in <xref ref="tab-numerics">Table</xref>, the various integer types 
      represent positive or negative whole numbers.
      Perhaps the most commonly used integer type in Java is the <c>int</c> type,
      which is represented in 32 bits.
      This means that Java can represent <m>2^{32}</m> different <c>int</c> values,
      which range from <m>-2{,}147{,}483{,}648</m> to <m>2{,}147{,}483{,}647</m>,
      that is, from <m>-2^{31}</m> to <m>(2^{31} -1)</m>.
      Similarly, an 8-bit integer,
      a <c>byte</c>, can represent <m>2^8</m> or 256  different values,
      ranging from <m>-128</m> to <m>+127</m>.
      A 16-bit integer,
      a <c>short</c>, can represent <m>2^{16}</m> different values,
      which range from <m>-32768</m> to <m>32767</m>.
      And a 64-bit integer,
      a <c>long</c>, can represent whole number values ranging from <m>-2^{63}</m> to <m>2^{63}-1</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For floating-point numbers,
      a 32-bit <c>float</c> type can represent <m>2^{32}</m> different real numbers and a 64-bit <c>double</c> value can represent <m>2^{64}</m> different real numbers.
    </p>
    <principle>
      <title>EFFECTIVE DESIGN: Platform Independence</title>
      <p>
        In Java, a data type's size
        (number of bits)
        is part of its definition and,
        therefore, remains consistent across all platforms.
        In C and C++, the size of a data type is dependent on the compiler.
      </p>
    </principle>
    <p>
      It is worth noting that just as model airplanes are representations of real airplanes, 
      Java's numeric types are representations or  models of the numbers we deal with in mathematics.
      In designing Java's data types,
      various trade-offs have been made in order to come up with practical implementations.
    </p>
    <p>
      One trade-off is that the set of integers is infinite,
      but Java's
<c>int</c> type can only represent a finite number of values.
      Similarly,  Java cannot represent the infinite number of values that occur between,
      say, 1.111 and 1.112.
      So, certain real numbers cannot be represented at all.
      For example,
      because Java uses binary numbers to represent its numeric types,
      one number that cannot be represented exactly is <m>\frac{1}{10}</m>.
      This inability to exactly represent a value is known as
      <term>round-off error</term>.
      Being unable to represent certain values can cause problems in a program.
      For example,
      it might be  difficult to represent dollars and cents accurately in a program.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another source of problems in dealing with numeric data is due to limits in their precision.
      For example,
      a decimal number represented as a double value can have a maximum of 17
      <em>significant digits</em>,
      and a <c>float</c> can have a maximum of  8.
      A significant digit is one that contributes to the number's value.
      If you tried to store values such as 12345.6789 or 0.123456789 in a <c>float</c> variable,
      they would be rounded off to 12345.679 and 0.12345679,
      respectively, causing a possible error.
    </p>
    <principle>
      <title>DEBUGGING TIP: Significant Digits</title>
      <p>
        In using numeric data,
        be sure the data type you choose has enough precision to represent 
        the values your program needs.
