<title>Java Application Programs</title>
<p>
      The HelloWorld program is an example of a Java
<term>application program</term>,
      or a Java application, for short.
      An application program is a stand-alone program,
<q>stand-alone</q>
      in the sense that it does not depend on any other program,
      like a Web browser, for its execution.
</p>
<p>
      Every Java application program must contain a <c>main()</c> method,
      which is where the program begins execution when it is run.
      For a program that contains several classes,
      it is up to the programmer to decide which class should contain the <c>main()</c> method.
      We don't have to worry about that decision for HelloWorld,
      because it contains just a single class.
</p>
<p>
      Because of its unique role as the starting point for every Java application program,
      it is very important that the header for the main method be declared exactly as shown in the <c>HelloWorld</c> class:
</p>
<program language="java"><input>
    public static void main(String args[])
</input></program>
<p>
      It must be declared <c>public</c> so it can be accessed from outside the class that contains it.
      And it must be declared <c>static</c>. Static methods are associated with their class, not with
      the class's objects or instances. Because of this, a static or <term>class method</term> can be 
      called before the program has created any instances (or objects) of that class. 
</p>
<p>
      This is important for <c>main()</c>'s special role as the program's starting point, because
<c>main()</c> is called by the Java runtime system before the program has created any objects.
</p>
<p>
      The <c>main()</c> method has a <c>void</c> return type,
      which means it does not return any kind of value.
</p>
<p>
      Finally, notice that <c>main()</c>'s parameter list contains a declaration of some 
      kind of <c>String</c> parameter named <em>args</em>.
      This is actually an array that can be used to pass string arguments to the program when it is started up.
      We won't worry about this feature until our chapter on arrays.
