<title>Java Library Packages</title>
<p>
      Recall that the <c>HelloWorld</c> program used two pre-defined classes,
      the <c>String</c> and the <c>System</c> classes.
      Both of these classes are basic language classes in Java.
      The <c>HelloWorldCanvas</c> program also uses pre-defined classes,
      such as <c>JFrame</c> and <c>Graphics</c>. However,
      these two classes are not part of Java's basic language classes.
      To understand the difference between these classes,
      it will be necessary to talk briefly about how the Java class library is organized.
</p>
<p>
      A <term>package</term> is a collection a inter-related classes in the Java class library.
      For example,
      the <c>java.lang</c> package contains classes,
      such as <c>Object</c>,<c>String</c>, and <c>System</c>, that are central to the Java language.
      Just about all Java programs use classes in this package.
      The <c>java.awt</c> package provides classes,
      such as <c>Button</c>,<c>TextField</c>, and <c>Graphics</c>, that are used in graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
      The <c>java.net</c> package provides classes used for networking tasks,
      and the <c>java.io</c> package provides classes used for input and output operations.
</p>
<p>
      All Java classes belong to some package,
      including those that are programmer defined.
      To assign a class to a package,
      you would provide a <c>package</c> statement as the first statement in the file that contains the class definition.
      For example,
      the files containing the definitions of the classes in the <c>java.lang</c> package all begin with the following statement.
</p>
 <program language="java"><input>
package java.lang;
 </input></program>
<p>
      If you omit <c>package</c> statement,
      as we do for the programs in this book, Java places such classes into an unnamed default package.
</p>
<p>
      Thus, for any Java class,
      its full name includes the name of the package that contains it.
      For example,
      the full name for the <c>System</c> class is <c>java.lang.System</c> and the full name for the <c>String</c> class 
      is <c>java.lang.String</c>. Similarly,
      the full name for the <c>Graphics</c> class is <c>java.awt.Graphics</c>. In short,
      the full name for a Java class takes the following form:
</p>
 <program language="java"><input>
package.class
 </input></program>

<p>
      In other words,
      the full name of any class has its package name as a prefix.
</p>
<p>
      Of all the packages in the Java library,
      only the classes in the <c>java.lang</c> package can be refererced  by their shorthand names.
      This means that when a program uses a class from the <c>java.lang</c> package,
      it can refer to it simply by its class name.
      For example,
      in the <c>HelloWorld</c> program we referred directly to the <c>String</c> class rather than to <c>java.lang.String</c>.
</p>

<subsection>
<title>The <c>import</c> Statement</title>
<p>
      The <c>import</c> statement makes Java classes available to programs under their abbreviated names.
      Any public class in the Java class library is available to a program by its fully qualified name.
      Thus, if a program was using the <c>Graphics</c> class,
      it could always refer to it as <c>java.awt.Graphics</c>. However,
      being able to refer to<c>Graphics</c> by its shorthand name,
      makes the program a bit shorter and more readable.
</p>
<p>
      The <c>import</c> statement doesn't actually load classes into the program.
      It just makes their abbreviated names available.
</p>
<p>
      The <c>import</c> statement takes two possible forms:
 <program language="java"><input>
        import package.class
 </input></program>
 <program language="java"><input>
        import package.*
 </input></program>
</p>
<p>
      The first form allows a specific class to be known by its abbreviated name.
      The second form,
      which uses the asterisk as a wildcard character ('*'), 
      allows all the classes in the specified package to be known by their short names.
      The <c>import</c> statements in <c>HelloWorldCanvas</c> are examples of the first form.
      The following example,
</p>
 <program language="java"><input>
import java.lang.*;
 </input></program>
<p>
      allows all classes in the <c>java.lang</c> package to be referred to by their class names alone.
      In fact, this particular
<c>import</c> statement is implicit in every Java program.
</p>

<title>Qualified Names in Java</title>
<p>
      In the previous subsections we have seen several examples of names in Java programs that used <em>dot notation</em>.
      A <term>qualified name</term> is a name that is separated into parts using Java's dot notation.
      Examples include package names,
      such as <c>java.awt</c>, class names,
      such as <c>javax.swing.JFrame</c>, and even method names,
      such as <c>helloworld.greet()</c>.
</p>
<p>
      Just as in our natural language,
      the meaning of a name within a Java program depends on the context.
      For example,
      the expression <c>helloworld.greet()</c> refers to the <c>greet()</c> method,
      which belongs to the <c>HelloWorld</c> class.
      If we were using this expression from within that class,
      you wouldn't need to qualify the name in this way.
      You could just refer to <c>greet()</c> and it would be clear from the context which method you meant.
</p>
<p>
      This is no different than using someone's first name (
<q>Kim</q>
      ) when there's only one Kim around, but using a full name (
<q>Kim Smith</q>
      ) when the first name alone would be too vague or ambiguous.
</p>
<!--
    <p>
      One thing that complicates the use of qualified names is that they are used to refer to different kinds of things within a Java program.
      But this is no different,
      really, than in our natural language, where names (
      <q>George Washington</q>
      ) can refer to people, bridges, universities, and so on.
      Here again, just as in our natural language, Java uses the context to understand the meaning of the name.
      For example,
      the expression <c>java.lang.System</c> refers to the <c>System</c> class in the <c>java.lang</c> package,
      whereas the expression
<c>System.out.print()</c> refers to a method in the <c>System.out</c> object.
    </p>
    <p>
      How can you tell these apart?
      Java can tell them apart because the first one occurs as part of an <c>import</c> statement,
      so it must be referring to something that belongs to a package.
      The second expression would only be valid in a context where a method invocation is allowed.
      You will have to learn a bit more about the Java language before you'll be able to completely understand these names,
      but the following provide some naming rules to get you started.

<title>Library Class Names</title>
<p>
        By convention,
        class names in Java begin with an uppercase letter.
        When referenced as part of a package,
        the class name is the last part of the name.
        For example, <c>java.lang.System</c> refers to the <c>System</c> class in the <c>java.lang</c> package.
</p>
</principle>
<principle>
<title>Dot Notation</title>
<p>
        Names expressed in Java's <term>dot notation</term>
        depend for their meaning on the context in which they are used.
        In qualified names<mdash/>
that is,
        names of the form X.Y.Z<mdash/>
the last item in the name (Z) is the
<term>referent</term>
<mdash/>
that is,
        the element being referred to.
        The items that precede it (X.Y.) are used to qualify or clarify the referent.
</p>
</principle>
<p>
      The fact that names are context dependent in this way certainly complicates the task of learning what's what in a Java program.
      Part of learning to use Java's built-in classes is learning where a particular object or method is defined.
      It is a syntax error if the Java compiler can't find the object or method that you are referencing.
</p>
<principle>
<title>DEBUGGING TIP: Not Found Error</title>
<p>
        If Java cannot find the item you are referring to, it will report an
<q>X not found</q>
        error, where X is the class, method,
        variable, or package being referred to.
</p>
</principle>
