  <title>Comments</title>
  <p>
	A <term>comment</term> is a non-executable portion of a program that is used to document the program.
	Because comments are not executable instructions they are just ignored by the compiler.
	Their sole purpose is to make the program easier for the programmer to read and understand.
  </p>
  <p>
	The <c>HelloWorld</c> program contains examples of two types of Java comments.
	Any text contained within /* and */ is considered a comment.
	As you can see in <c>HelloWorld</c>, this kind of comment can extend over several lines and is sometimes called a
    <em>multiline</em> comment.
	A second type of comment is any text that follows double slashes (//) on a line.
	This is known as a <em>single-line comment</em>
	because it cannot extend beyond a single line.
  </p>
  <p>
	When the compiler encounters the beginning marker (/*) of a multiline comment,
	it skips over everything until it finds a matching end marker (*/).
	One implication of this is that it is not possible to put one multiline comment inside of another.
	That is, one comment cannot be <em>nested</em>,
	or contained, within another comment.
	The following code segment illustrates the rules that govern the use of /* and */:
  </p>
  <program language="java">
  <input>
     /* This first comment begins and ends on the same line. */
     /* A second comment starts on this line ...
	and goes on ...
	and this is the last line of the second comment.
     */
     /* A third comment starts on this line ...
	 /* This is NOT a fourth comment. It is just
	    part of the third comment.
	And this is the last line of the third comment.
     */
     */  This is an error because it is an unmatched end marker.
  </input></program>
  <p>
	As you can see from this example,
	it is impossible to begin a new comment inside an already-started comment because all text inside the first comment,
	including /*, is ignored by the compiler.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <title>Comment</title>
    <p>
	  Any text contained within /* and */, which may span several lines,
	  is considered a comment and is ignored by the compiler.
	  Inserting double slashes (//) into a line turns the rest of the line into a comment.
    </p>
  </definition>
  <p>
	Multiline comments are often used to create a <em>comment block</em>
	that provides useful documentation for the program.
	In <c>HelloWorld</c>, the program begins with a comment block that identifies the name of file that contains the program and its author and provides a brief description of what the program does.
  </p>
  <p>
	For single-line comments,
	double slashes (//) can be inserted anywhere
	on a line of code.
	The result is that the rest of the line is ignored by the compiler.
	We use single-line comments throughout the <c>HelloWorld</c> program to provide a running commentary of its language elements.
  </p>
  <principle>
    <title>PROGRAMMING TIP: Use of Comments</title>
    <p>
	A well-written program should begin with a comment block that provides the name of the program,
	its author, and a description of what the program does.
    </p>
  </principle>
