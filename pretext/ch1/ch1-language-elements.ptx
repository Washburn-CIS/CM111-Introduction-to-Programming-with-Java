  <title>Java Language Elements</title>
   <subsection> <title>Introduction</title>
  <p>
      In this section we will introduce some of the key elements of the Java language by describing the details of a small program.
      We will look at how a program is organized and what the various parts do.
      Our intent is to introduce important language elements,
      many of which will be explained in greater detail in later sections.
  </p>
  <p>
      The program we will study is a Java version of the traditional HelloWorld program<mdash/>
''traditional'' because practically every introductory programming text begins with it.
      When it is run, the HelloWorld program (<xref ref="lstng_helloworld"></xref>) just displays the greeting
  <q>Hello, World!</q>
      on the console.
</p>
<listing xml:id="lstng_helloworld"> 
  <caption>The <c>HelloWorld</c> application program.</caption>
<program language="java">
  <input>
	/*
	 * File: HelloWorld.java
	 * Author: Joseph Kendall-Morwick
	 * Description: Prints Hello World! greeting.
	 */
    public class HelloWorld { // Class header
		 public static void main(String args[]) { // Method header
			  System.out.println("Hello World!"); // Output greeting
		 }  // End main()
    } // End class body
  </input>
  </program>
</listing>

<p>Try the Hello World program below.</p>

<activity label="HelloWorldEx">
      <statement><p>Run the following code. 
        Try changing the greeting to "Hola!" and run again.</p></statement>
      <program language="java" interactive="activecode"><input>
	/*
	 * File: HelloWorld.java
	 * Author: Joseph Kendall-Morwick
	 * Description: Prints Hello World! greeting.
	 */
    public class HelloWorld { // Class header
		 public static void main(String args[]) { // Method header
			  System.out.println("Hello World!"); // Output greeting
		 }  //  End main()
    } // End class body
    </input></program></activity>

<subsection>
  <title>Program Layout</title>
  <p>
	Notice how the program is  neatly arranged on the page.
	This is done deliberately so that the program is easy to read and understand.
  </p>
  <p>
	In Java, program expressions and statements may be arranged any way the programmer likes.
	They may occur one per line, several per line, or one per several lines.
	But the fact that the rules governing the layout of the program are so lax 
        makes it all the more important that we adopt a good programming style,
	one that will help make programs easy to read.
  </p>
  <p>
	So look at how things are presented in <c>HelloWorld</c> (    <xref ref="lstng_helloworld"></xref>). 
        Notice how beginning and ending braces, { and }, are aligned.
	Braces are used to mark the beginning and end of different blocks of code (blocks are explained below)
        in a Java program and it can sometimes be difficult to know which beginning and end braces are matched up.
	Proper indentation and the use of single-line comments (also explained below) make it easier to determine how the braces are matched up.
  </p>
  <p>
	Similarly, notice how indentation is used to show when one element of the program is contained within another element.
	Thus, the elements of the <c>HelloWorld</c> class are indented inside of the braces that mark the beginning and end of the class.
	And the statements in the <c>main()</c> method are indented to indicate that they belong to that method.
	Use of indentation in this way,	to identify the program's structure,	makes the program easier to read and understand.
  </p>
  <principle>
    <title>PROGRAMMING TIP: Use of Indentation</title>
    <p>
	  Indent the code within a block and align the block's opening and closing braces.
	  Use a comment to mark the end of a block of code.
    </p>
  </principle>
