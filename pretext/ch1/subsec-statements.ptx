<title>Statements</title>
<p>
      A Java program is a collection of statements.
      A <term>statement</term> is a 
      segment of code that takes some action in the program.
      As a program runs, we say it <em>executes</em> statements,
      meaning it carries out the actions specified by those statements.
</p>
<p>
      In our <c>HelloWorld</c> program (<xref ref="lstng_helloworld"></xref>),
      statements of various types occur on lines 8, 11, 15, 16, and 17.
      Notice that all of these lines end with a semicolon.
</p>
<principle>
<title>JAVA LANGUAGE RULE: Semicolons</title>
<p>
       In Java statements must end with a semicolon.
       Forgetting to do so would cause a syntax error.

</p>
</principle>

<p>
      A <term>declaration statement</term>
      is a statement that declares a variable of a particular type.
      In a Java program, a variable must be declared before it can be used.
</p>



<p>
One kind of Java statement is a <term>method-call statement</term>, as in the example from the 
<c>HelloWorld</c> program (<xref ref="lstng_helloworld"></xref>):
</p>
<program language="java"><input>
    System.out.println("Hello World!"); // Output greeting
</input></program>
<p>
      We can use curly braces to group one or more statements into a sequence. These groups are 
      called a <term>block</term>. 
      
      For example, 
      we could output the greeting one part at a time with several different statements. Notice
      in the example below that the first two statements call the 'print' method instead of
      'println'. The difference between these methods is that 'println' will advance the 
      cursor on the terminal to the next line, so we'll make that call last. 
</p>
<program language="java"><input>
public static void main(String args[]) { // Method header 			  
      System.out.print("Hello"); // Output "hello"	  	  
      System.out.print(" "); // Output a space	  
      System.out.println("Hello World!"); // Output "world!"
}  //  main()
</input></program>
