    <title>Arithmetic Operators</title>
      <p>
        The operations that can be done on numeric data include the standard algebraic operations:
        <em>addition</em> (+), <em>subtraction</em> (<m>-</m>),
        <em>multiplication</em> (*), <em>division</em>
        (/), as well as the <em>modulus</em> (%) operator.
        Note that in Java,
        the multiplication symbol is <c>*</c> and not the <times/>.
        The arithmetic operators are binary operators,  meaning that they each take two operands. 
        <xref ref="tab-numops">Table</xref> compares expressions involving the 
        Java operators with their standard algebraic counterparts.

      <p>
        Although these operations should seem familiar,
        there are some important differences between their use in algebra and their use in a Java program.
        Consider the following list of expressions:
      </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
3 / 2     ==>  value 1     An integer result
3.0 / 2.0 ==>  value 1.5   A floating-point result
3 / 2.0   ==>  value 1.5   A floating-point result
3.0 / 2   ==>  value 1.5   A floating-point result
 </input></program>
      <p>
        In each of these cases we are dividing the quantity 3 by the quantity<nbsp/>2.
        However, different results are obtained depending on the <em>type</em>
        of the operands involved.
        When both operands are integers, as in (3/2),
        the result must also be an integer.
            <idx><h>integer division</h></idx>
        Hence, (3/2) has the value 1, an integer.
        Because integers cannot have a fractional part,
        the 0.5 is simply discarded.
        Integer division (/) always gives an integer  result.
        Thus, the value of (6/2) is 3 and the value of (7/2) is also 3.
        Because 3.5 is not an integer,
        the result of dividing 7 by 2 cannot be 3.5.
      </p>
      <principle>
        <title>DEBUGGING TIP: Integer Division</title>
        <p>
          A common source of error among beginning programmers 
          is forgetting that integer division always gives an integer result.
        </p>
      </principle>
      <p>
        On the other hand, when either operand is a real number,
        as in the last three cases, the result is a real number.
        Thus, while the same symbol (/) is used for dividing integers and real numbers,
        there are really two different operations involved here:
        <em>integer division</em> and <em>floating-point division
            <idx><h>floating-point division</h></idx>
        </em>.
        Using the same symbol (/) for different operations
        (integer division and real division)
        is known as <term>operator overloading</term>.
        It is similar to method overloading,
        which was discussed in Chapter<nbsp/>3.
      </p>

        What if you want to keep the remainder of an integer division?
        Java  provides the modulus operator (%), which takes two operands.
        The expression (7 % 5) gives the remainder after dividing 7 by 5 <mdash/> that is, 
        2 in this case.
        In general, the expression <m>(m \; \% \; n)</m>
        (read <em>m</em> mod <em>n</em>)
        gives the remainder after <em>m</em>
        is divided by <em>n</em>.
        Here are several examples:
      </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
 7 % 5   ==> 7 mod 5 equals 2
 5 % 7   ==> 5 mod 7 equals 5
-7 % 5   ==> -7 mod 5 equals -2
 7 % -5  ==> 7 mod -5 equals 2
 </input></program>
      <p>
        The best way to interpret these examples is to perform long division on the operands keeping both the quotient and the remainder.
        For example, when you do long division on <m>-7 \div 5</m>,
        you get a quotient of -1 and a remainder of -2.
        The quotient is the value of <m>-7/5</m> and the remainder is the value of <m>-7 \% 5</m>.
        When you do long division on <m>7 \div -5</m>,
        you get a quotient of -1 and a remainder of 2.
        The quotient is the value of <m>7/-5</m> and the remainder is the value of <m>7\%-5</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will encounter many practical uses for the modulus operator in our programs.
        For a simple example,
        we use it when we want to determine whether an integer is even or odd.
        Numbers that leave a 0 remainder when divided by 2 are even:
      </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
if (N % 2 == 0)
    System.out.println(N + " is even");
 </input></program>
      <p>
        More generally,
        we could use the mod operator to define divisibility by 3, 4, 10, or by any number.

             if (age1 % 2 == 0)
                System.out.println(age1 + " is even");
             else
                System.out.println(age1 + " is odd");   
           }
        }
