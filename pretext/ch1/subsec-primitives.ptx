<title>Data Types</title>
<p>
      A computer program wouldn't be very useful if it couldn't manipulate different kinds of data,
      such as numbers and strings.
      The operations that one can perform on data depend on the data's type.
      For example, you can divide and multiply numbers,
      but you cannot do this with strings.
      Thus, all data in a Java program is classified according to its <term>data type</term>.
</p>
<p>
      Broadly speaking, there are two categories of data in Java: objects and <term>primitive data types</term>.
      Java has many different types of built-in objects, in addition to those objects defined by programmers, 
      Two built-in objects we encounter in this chapter are the <c>String</c> and <c>PrintStream</c> objects.
</p>
<p>
      Java's primitive types include three integer types,
      three real number types,
      a character type, and a boolean type with values true and false.
      The names of the primitive types are keywords like<c>int</c> for one integer type, <c>double</c> for one real number type,
      and <c>boolean</c>.
</p>
<p>
      A <term>literal value</term> is an actual value of some type that occurs in a program.
      For example, a string enclosed in double quotes,
      such as "Hello, World!", is known as a <c>String</c> literal.
      A number such as 45.2 would be an example of a literal of type <c>double</c>, and -72 would be an 
      example of a literal of type <c>int</c>. 
</p>
<p>
      Our HelloWorld program contains just a single literal value,
      the "HelloWorld!" <c>String</c>.
