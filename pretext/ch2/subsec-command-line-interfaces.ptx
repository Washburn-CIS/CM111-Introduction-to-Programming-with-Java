  <title>A Command-Line Interface</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      A command-line interface is perhaps the simplest, and most old-fashioned,
      way to design the interaction between a user and a program.
      According to this approach, user input is taken from the keyboard,
      and the program's output is displayed on some kind of console (<xref ref="fig-command-line"></xref>).
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig-command-line">
      <caption>A command-line user interface.</caption>
      <image width="73%" source="chptr04/cmdline.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The command-line approach might also be called
      <em>console interface</em>.
      In the early days of computers,
      before we had graphics-based computer monitors capable of displaying multiple windows,
      the console was the entire computer display.
      For today's computers the console might be a window provided by your programming environment,
      as in <xref ref="fig-console">Figure</xref>.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig-console">
      <caption>The Java console window.</caption>
      <image width="63%" source="chptr04/console.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      In Chapter 3 we described how to use the <c>System.out.print()</c> and
<c>System.out.println()</c> methods to output strings to the console.
      That takes care of the output side of command-line interface.
      The more challenging task is managing the input-side of the interface.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Java, input and output is handled by objects that are called <term>streams</term>.
      You can think of a stream as a kind of pipe through which data flow (<xref ref="fig-streams"></xref>).
      An <term>input stream</term>  carries data from some kind of input device,
      such as a keyboard or network connection or a file,
      to the program's main memory.
      An <em>output stream</em> carries data from the program's memory to some kind of output device,
      such as a printer or a file.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig-streams">
      <caption>Input and output streams.</caption>
      <image width="80%" source="chptr04/streams.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Each Java program has three standard streams available to it at startup: <c>System.in</c>, <c>System.out</c>, and <c>System.err</c>.
<c>System.in</c> is a predefined input stream that is typically associated with the keyboard (<xref ref="fig-streams"></xref>).
      That is, it carries data from the keyboard to the program. <c>System.out</c> and
<c>System.err</c> are both output streams typically associated with the console.
      They both carry data from the program to the console.
      The difference is simply that <c>System.out</c> is used for normal program output and <c>System.err</c> is used to output error messages.

  <subsubsection>
    <title>Inputting Numbers from the Keyboard</title>
    <p>
      As the previous section showed,
      we can use a <c>BufferedReader</c> object to input <c>String</c> s from the keyboard.
      In Java, all keyboard input is represented as <c>String</c> s.
      However, what if we want to input numbers?
      The answer is that we have to extract numbers from the input strings.
      To do this, Java provides us two special classes,
      known as wrapper classes: <c>Integer</c> and <c>Double</c>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <term>wrapper class</term> contains methods for converting primitive  data into objects and for converting data from one type to another.
      The <c>Integer</c> class contains the <c>parseInt()</c> method,
      which extracts an <c>int</c> from its <c>String</c> argument.
      For example, in the following usage,
      the string "55" is converted into the number 55:
    </p>

<program language="java">
    <input>
    int m = Integer.parseInt("55");
    </input>
</program>

    <p>
      Similarly, the <c>Double</c> class contains the
<c>parseDouble()</c> method,
      which extracts a <c>double</c> value from its parameter.
      In this example,
      the number 55.2 is extracted from the string "55.2":
    </p>

<program language="java">
    <input>
    double num = Double.parseDouble("55.2");
    </input>
</program>

    <p>
      If we are writing a program that requires us to input numbers from the keyboard,
      then assuming we have created a <c>BufferedReader</c> object named <c>input</c>, we can use these methods in combination with the <c>readLine()</c> method,
      to input and process numbers.
      For example, this code segment calculates a runner's race pace:
    </p>

<program language="java">
    <input>
    String inputString = new String();
    System.out.println("How many total miles did you run? ");
    inputString = input.readLine();   // Input a String}
    double miles = Double.parseDouble(inputString); // Convert
    System.out.println("How many minutes did it take you? ");
    inputString = input.readLine();   // Input another String
    double minutes = Double.parseDouble(inString);  // Convert
    System.out.println("Your average pace was " + minutes/miles + " minutes per mile");
    </input>
</program>

    <p>
      Notice how we included prompts in this example so that the user knows what type of input is expected.
      Designing appropriate prompts is an important aspect of designing a good user interface.
    </p>
    <principle>
      <title>EFFECTIVE DESIGN:Prompting</title>
      <p>
        In a well-designed user interface,
        prompts should be used to guide the user through the input process.
      </p>
    </principle>

  <subsubsection xml:id="self-study-exercisesA14">
    <title>Designing a Command-Line Interface</title>
    <p>
      Now that we have defined a special class for performing keyboard input,
      we now show how it can be used as a user interface in cooperation with the other objects that make up a program.
      As described in <xref ref="fig-ui">Figure</xref>,
      the user interface will serve as an intermediary between the user and some type of computational object.
      Although our command-line interface should work with any application,
      no matter how complex, we begin with a very simple computational problem.
      This will allow us to focus on the user interface.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's design a program that prompts the user for his or her name and then says hello.
      Thus, the program's I/O should look like this:
    </p>

<program language="java">
    <input>
Hi, please input your name here > Kim
  Hi Kim, nice to meet you.
    </input>
</program>

    <p>
      In the design we use there will be two primary objects involved.
      One will serve as the user interface.
      This will be our <c>KeyboardReader</c>. A second object will serve as the computational object.
      In this case it will
      <q>compute</q>
      an appropriate greeting.
      It will serve contain the <c>main()</c> method and will encapsulate the algorithm for this application.
      It will use a <c>KeyboardReader</c> to handle its I/O needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main advantage of this division of labor is that it enables us to use the <c>KeyboardReader</c>, as is,
      with virtually any Java application.
      Moreover, despite its simplicity,
      our computational object in this example can serve as a template for future programs.
    </p>
    <principle>
      <title>EFFECTIVE DESIGN:Modularity</title>
      <p>
        By designing the user interface as a self-contained module,
        we can use it with just about any application.
      </p>
    </principle>
    <p>
      <xref ref="fig-greeter">Figure</xref>
      provides the details the design we wish to implement.
      Note that <c>GreeterApp</c> contains an instance variable for a <c>KeyboardReader</c>. This will enable it to use the <c>KeyboardReader</c> whenever it needs to perform keyboard input.
      By giving
<c>GreeterApp</c> a <c>main()</c> method,
      we allow it to be the main class for our application.
      Its <c>run()</c> method will contain the algorithm that controls the application,
      and its <c>greet()</c> method will handle the task of greeting the user.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig-greeter">
      <caption>Using <c>KeyboardReader</c> as the user interface.</caption>
      <image width="80%" source="chptr04/greeter.png"/>
    </figure>
    <p>
      The full implementation of the <c>GreeterApp</c> class is shown in 
      <xref ref="fig-greeterapp">Listing</xref>.
      It begins by declaring an instance
    </p>
    <listing xml:id="fig-greeterapp">
      <caption>Definition of the <c>GreeterApp</c> class.</caption>

<program language="java">
    <input>
public class GreeterApp
{   private KeyboardReader reader;
    public GreeterApp()
    {   reader = new KeyboardReader();
    } // GreeterApp()
    public void run()
    {   String name = "";
        reader.prompt("Please input your name here > ");
        name = reader.getKeyboardInput();
        reader.display(greet(name) + "\n");
    } // run()
    public String greet(String name)
    {   return "Hi " + name + " nice to meet you.";
    } // greet()
    public static void main(String args[])
    {   GreeterApp app = new GreeterApp();
        app.run();
    }
  } // GreaterApp
    </input>
</program>

    </listing>
    <p>
      variable for the <c>KeyboardReader</c>, which is instantiated in the constructor method.
      This gives <c>GreeterApp</c> a way to refer directly to the user interface whenever it needs keyboard input.
      The
<c>run()</c> method encapsulates the application's algorithm.
      Notice how it uses the <c>KeyboardReader</c> to prompt the user,
      to input the user's name, and then to display the greeting.
      Finally, the <c>main()</c> method serves to create an instance of the computational object and calls its <c>run()</c> method.
    </p>
    <p>
      To re-cap, we have designed a simple command-line interface that can be used,
      with minor changes,
      for virtually any programming task in subsequent chapters.
      Before moving on,
      it may be helpful to touch on some of the important object-oriented principles that went into our design.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Divide-and-conquer: We see the usefulness of dividing a program into separate objects,
            one to handle the computations required by the application,
            and one to handle the user interface.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Encapsulation: The classes we designed encapsulate just the information and behavior that is necessary to perform their specific roles.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Information hiding: We use a private method to hide certain messy implementation details from other parts of the program.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Generality and Extensibility: We have developed a design that is general enough that it can be extended to other applications.
          </p>

        <title>HiLow Guessing Game</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Java's <c>Math</c> class has a static method that will generate a random number
             between 0 and 0.99999999<mdash/>that is,
            between 0 and 1, not including 1.
            By using simple arithmetic,
            we can generate random numbers between any two values.
            For example,
            the following statement assigns a random integer between 1 and 100 to the 
            variable:


<program language="java">
    <input>
    secretNumber = 1 + (int)(Math.random() * 100);
    </input>
</program>
 Given this statement, design and implement an application that will play the following guessing game with the user.
 The computer generates a random number between 1 and 100 and then lets the user guess the number,
 telling the user when the guess is too high or too low.
 Note that for this problem, the user will have to input integers at the keyboard, 
 so you will have to use a development environment with user input possible, like replit.
