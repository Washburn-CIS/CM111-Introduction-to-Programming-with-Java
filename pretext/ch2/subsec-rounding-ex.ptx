    <title>Example: Rounding to Two Decimal Places</title>
    <p>
      As an example of how to use <c>Math</c> class methods,
      let's consider the problem of rounding numbers.
      When dealing with applications that involve monetary 
      values<mdash/>dollars and cents<mdash/>it is often necessary to 
      round a calculated result to two decimal places.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example,
      suppose a program computes the value of a certificate of deposit (CD) to be 75.19999.
      Before we output this result,
      we would want to round it to two decimal places<mdash/>to 75.20. 
      The following algorithm can be used to accomplish this:
    </p>
 <algorithm>
  <title>Rounding to 2 decimal places</title>
  <program language="java"><input>
1. Multiply the number by 100, giving 7519.9999.
2. Add 0.5 to the number giving 7520.4999.
3. Drop the fractional part giving 7520
4. Divide the result by 100, giving 75.20
 </input></program>
 </algorithm>
    <p>
      Step 3 of this algorithm can be done using the <c>Math.floor(R)</c> method,
      which rounds its real argument,
      <em>R</em>, to the largest integer not less than <em>R</em>
      (from <xref ref="tab-math">Table</xref>).
      If the number to be rounded is stored in the <c>double</c> variable <em>R</em>,
      then the following expression will round <c>R</c> to two decimal places:
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
R = Math.floor(R * 100.0 + 0.5) / 100.0;
 </input></program>
    <p>
      Alternatively,
      we could use the <c>Math.round()</c> method ( <xref ref="tab-math">Table</xref>).
      This method rounds a floating-point value to the nearest integer.
      For example, <c>Math.round(65.3333)</c> rounds to 65 and <c>Math.round(65.6666)</c> 
      rounds to 66.
      The following expression uses it to round to two decimal places:
    </p>
 <program language="java"><input>
R = Math.round(100.0 * R) / 100.0;
 </input></program>
    <p>
      Note that it is important here to divide by <m>100.0</m> and not by <m>100</m>.
      Otherwise, the division will give an integer result and we'll lose the decimal places.
    </p>

        Using the correct type of literal in division operations 
        is necessary to ensure that you get the correct type of result.
