    <title>Exceptions</title>
    <p>
      There are lots of things that can go wrong when performing input. For example, if your
      program calls <c>nextInt()</c> to input an integer and the user types <q>hello</q>,
      the program will be terminated with an error message.
    </p>
    <p>
      Generally, Java programs use <term>Exceptions</term> to handle such situations. We deliberately
      chose the <c>Scanner</c> class because it doesn't require us to deal with exceptions
      right now. We'll cover that topic in chapter 11.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it's important to realize that our strategy for handling keyboard input with
      the <c>Scanner</c> class is a temporary solution.

    <title>Keyboard Input with the <c>KeyboardReader</c>Class</title>
    <p>
      <image width="73%" source="chptr02/kbreaderuml.png"/> If you are using an older version of Java that does not have the <c>Scanner</c> class,
      a user-defined class can be used instead.
      A <c>KeyboardReader</c> class that uses the <c>BufferedReader</c> class will be developed in Chapter<nbsp/>4.
      It has methods that read data from the keyboard in a manner very similar to those of the <c>Scanner</c> class.
      A partial list of its public methods is given in the UML class diagram shown in Figure<nbsp/>2.27.
      To use the <c>KeyboardReader</c> class for keyboard input,
      copy the source code <c>KeyboardReader.java</c> from Chapter<nbsp/>4 into the same directory as the source code of your current Java class
      (and add it to your current project if you are using a integrated development environment).
    </p>
    <p>
      To use a <c>KeyboardReader</c> object,
      we need to create an instance of the class with a constructor.
      Then calling one of the three methods will return an <c>int</c>, <c>double</c>, or <c>String</c> when data is input from the keyboard.
      Any of the three methods of a <c>KeyboardReader</c> object will attempt to process the entire string input from the keyboard up to the point that the enter key is hit.
      That is, the character or characters generated by hitting the return or enter key is the delimiter used by <c>KeyboardReader</c>. The <c>TestKeyboardReader</c> class definition in <xref ref="fig-kbreaderprog">Figure</xref>
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig-kbreaderprog">
      <caption>A very brief program with a KeyboardReader object used for keyboard input.</caption>
 <program language="java"><input>
public class TestKeyboardReader
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {             // Create KeyboardReader object
    KeyboardReader kb = new KeyboardReader();
    System.out.print("Input an integer:"); // Prompt
    int num = kb.getKeyboardInteger(); // Read an integer
    System.out.println(num + " squared = " + num*num);
  } //main()} // TestKeyboardReader class
 </input></program>
    </figure>
    <p>
      reads an integer from the keyboard and squares it just like the <c>TestScanner</c> class.
      In the remainder of the text,
      any time the <c>Scanner</c> class is used for keyboard input,
      the same program can be run using the <c>KeyboardReader</c> class after making the obvious substitutions.

      <title>TestScanner for Decimals</title>
         <statement> <p>
            Modify the <c>main()</c> method of the <c>TestScanner</c> class 
            (<xref ref="list-scannerprog">Listing</xref>)
             so that it reads a real number (a decimal number) from the keyboard rather than an integer. 
             You can test this below by changing the <term>Input for Program</term> from 25 to 2.5, and you should 
             see a result of 6.25.
