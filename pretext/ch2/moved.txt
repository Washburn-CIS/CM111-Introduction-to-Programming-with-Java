<title>Variables</title>
<p>
      A <term>variable</term> is a named storage location that can store a value of a particular type.
      You can think of a variable as a special container into which you can place values 
      (<xref ref="fig_vars"></xref>),
      but only values that fit into that type of variable .
      For example, an <c>int</c> variable can store values like 5 or -100.
      A <c>String</c> variable can store values like
<q>Hello</q>. 

<figure xml:id="fig_vars">
<caption>Variables are like <em>typed</em> containers. An <c>int</c> variable can only store whole numbers
       and a <c>String</c> can only store strings.</caption>

</p>
<p>
      In the <c>HelloWorld</c> class (<xref ref="lstng_helloworld"></xref>),
      the instance variable <c>greeting</c>
      (line 8) stores a value of type <c>String</c>. In the <c>main()</c> method,
      the variable <c>helloworld</c> is assigned a <c>HelloWorld</c> object
      (line 16).

<title>JAVA LANGUAGE RULE: Variable Declaration</title>
<p>
       In Java, all variables must be declaraed before they can be used.
      Failure to do so would cause a syntax error.
</p>
</principle>
<p>
      In its simplest form,
      a declaration statement begins with the 
      variable's type,
      which is followed by the variable's name,
      and ends with a semicolon:
</p>
<p>
<em>Type VariableName</em> ; 
</p>
<p>
      A variable's type is either one of the primitive types we mentioned,
      such as <c>int</c>,<c>double</c>, or <c>boolean</c>, or for objects,
      it is the name of the object's class,
      such as <c>String</c> or <c>HelloWorld</c>. Here are some examples: 
</p>
<program language="java"><input>
    HelloWorld helloworld;
    int num1;
    int num2;
</input></program>
<p>
      The first declaration declares a variable namrd <c>helloworld</c> of type <c>HelloWorld</c>.
      The next two declarations declare <c>int</c> variables named <c>num1</c> and <c>num2</c>. 
</p>
<p>
      What's the purpose of declaration statements?  Without going into too much detail at this point,
      declaring a variable causes the program to set aside enough memory for the type of data that will be stored in that variable.
      So in this example, Java would reserve enough space to store an <c>int</c> value, such as 25 or 1000.
</p>
<p>
      An <term>assignment statement</term>
      is a statement that assigns a value to a variable <mdash/>
 i.e., stores a value in the variable's memory location.
      An assignment statement uses the equal sign (<m>=</m>) as an assignment operator.
      In its simplest form,
      an assignment statement has a variable on the left hand side of the equals sign and some type of value on the right hand side.
      Like other statements, an assignment statement ends with a semicolon:
</p>
<p>
<em>VariableName</em>  =<em>Value</em> ;
</p>
<principle>
<title>JAVA LANGUAGE RULE: Assignment Operator</title>
<p>
       In Java, the equal sign (<c>=</c>) is used as the assignment operator.
</p>
</principle>
<p>
      When it executes an assignment statement, Java will first determine what value is given on the right hand side and then assign that 
       value to the variable on the left hand side. 
     For example, consider these three assignment statements: 
</p>
<program language="java"><input>
    num1 = 50;        // (a) Assign 50 to num1
    num2 = 10 + 15;   // (b) Assign 25 to num2
    num1 = num2;      // (c) Copy num2's value (25) into num1
</input></program>
<p>
      In (a) the value on the right hand side is 50.
      So 50 gets stored in <c>num1</c>, resulting 
      in the situation shown in the top row of <xref ref="fig_assign">Figure</xref>.
</p>
<p>
<figure xml:id="fig_assign">
<caption>Illustrates changes in variables <c>num1</c> and <c>num2</c> as a result off 
       the three assignments, (a), (b) and (c).</caption>
<image width="50%" source="chptr01/assign.png"/>
</figure>
</p>
<p>
      In (b) the value on the right hand side is 25,
      the result of adding  10 and 15. So 25 gets assigned to <c>num2</c>, leading to the situation shown in
      in row two of the figure.
      In (c) the value on the right hand side is 25, the value of <c>num2</c>, 
      which is stored in <c>num1</c>, as depicted in row three of the  drawing.
</p>
<p>
      The last of these assignments, (c), has variables on both sides of the equal sign, which 
      can be confusing to beginning programmers. It might look like we're saying that <c>num1</c>
<em>equals</em>
<c>num2</c>. But, remember, the equal sign is the assignment operator. So, this statement is saying: take the
      value stored in <c>num2</c> and store it in <c>num1</c>. 
</p>
<p>
<observation>
      Whenever a variable occurs on
      the right hand side of an assignment operator, we are using its value. We are treating it as a value.

<subsection>
<title>Creating and Using Objects</title>
<p>
      The body of the <c>main()</c> method is where the <c>HelloWorld</c> program creates its one and only object.
      When it is run the <c>HelloWorld</c> program simply prints
<q>Hello World!</q> on the console.
      In order for this action happen,
      the program needs to call the <c>greet()</c> method.
</p>
<p>
      However, because the <c>greet()</c> method is an instance method that belongs to a <c>HelloWorld</c> object,
      we first need to create a <c>HelloWorld</c> instance.
      This is what happens in the body of the <c>main()</c> method:  
<!--  (
      <xref ref="fig_helloworld"></xref>).
    </p>
    <p>
      The <c>main()</c> method contains three statements:
-->
</p>
<program language="java"><input>
    HelloWorld helloworld;          // Variable declaration
    helloworld = new HelloWorld();  // Object instantiation
    helloworld.greet();             // Method invocation
</input></program>
<p>
      The first statement declares a variable of type <c>HelloWorld</c>, which is then assigned a <c>HelloWorld</c> object.
</p>
<p>
      The second statement creates a <c>HelloWorld</c> object by
      invoking <c>HelloWorld</c>'s default constructor: <c>HelloWorld()</c>.
      A default constructor has the same name as the class and merely creates
      an object of that class. It is defined automatically by Java 
      and looks like this:
</p>
<program language="java"><input>
     public HelloWorld() {  }  // Default constructor
</input></program>
<p>  
      Creating an object is called <term>object instantiation</term>
      because you are creating an instance of the object.
      Once a <c>HelloWorld</c> instance is created,
      we can use one of its instance methods to perform some task or operation.
</p>
<p>
      Thus, in the third statement,
      we call the <c>greet()</c> method,
      which will print
<q>Hello World!</q>
      on the console.
</p>

<p>
      The <c>HelloWorld</c> program (<xref ref="lstng_helloworld"></xref>)illustrates the idea that an 
      object-oriented program is a collection of interacting objects.
      Although we create just a single <c>HelloWorld</c> object in the <c>main()</c> method,
      there are two other objects used in the program.
      One is the <c>greeting</c> object, the <q>Hello, World!</q>
<c>String</c>. 
      The other is the <c>System.out</c> object,
      which is a special Java system object used for printing.
</p>
</subsection>
<subsection>
<title>Java JFrames</title>
<p>
      Java can run a program in a <term>JFrame</term>
      so that the output and interaction occurs in a Window
      (or Frame).
<xref ref="fig_hellojframe">Listing</xref>
      shows a Java program named <c>HelloWorldCanvas</c>. This program does more or less the same thing as
      the <c>HelloWorld</c> application<mdash/>   it displays the <q>Hello, World!</q>
      greeting.    The difference is that it displays the greeting within a Window rather than directly on the console.
</p>
<listing xml:id="fig_hellojframe">
<caption>
<c>HelloWorldCanvas</c> program.</caption>

 <program language="java"><input>
/** File: HelloWorldCanvas program */
import javax.swing.JFrame; // Import class names
import java.awt.Graphics;
import java.awt.Canvas;
public class HelloWorldCanvas extends Canvas // Class header
{
    // Start of body
    public void paint(Graphics g)  // The paint method
    {
        g.drawString("Hello, World!", 10, 10);
    }  // End of paint

    public static void main(String[] args)   // The main() method
    {   HelloWorldCanvas c = new HelloWorldCanvas();
        JFrame f = new JFrame();
        f.add(c);
        f.setSize(150,50);
        f.setVisible(true);
    }  // End of main
}  // End of HelloWorldCanvas
 </input></program>
</listing>
<p>
      As in the case of the <c>HelloWorld</c> console application program, <c>HelloWorldCanvas</c> consists of a class definition.
      It contains a single method definition,
      the <c>paint()</c> method,
      which contains a single executable statement:
</p>
 <program language="java"><input>
g.drawString("Hello, World!",10,10);
 </input></program>
<p>
      This statement displays the
<q>Hello, World!</q>
      message directly in a Window.
      The <c>drawString()</c> method is one of the many drawing and painting methods defined in the <c>Graphics</c> class.
      Every Java Canvas comes with its own <c>Graphics</c> object,
      which is referred to here simply as <c>g</c>. Thus,
      we are using that object's
<c>drawString()</c> method to draw on the window.
      Don't worry if this seems a bit mysterious now.
      We'll explain it more fully when we take up graphics examples again.
