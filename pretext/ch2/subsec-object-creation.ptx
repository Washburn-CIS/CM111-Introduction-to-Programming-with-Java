<title>Creating and Using Objects</title>
<p>
      The body of the <c>main()</c> method is where the <c>HelloWorld</c> program creates its one and only object.
      When it is run the <c>HelloWorld</c> program simply prints
<q>Hello World!</q> on the console.
      In order for this action happen,
      the program needs to call the <c>greet()</c> method.
</p>
<p>
      However, because the <c>greet()</c> method is an instance method that belongs to a <c>HelloWorld</c> object,
      we first need to create a <c>HelloWorld</c> instance.
      This is what happens in the body of the <c>main()</c> method:  
<!--  (
      <xref ref="fig_helloworld"></xref>).
    </p>
    <p>
      The <c>main()</c> method contains three statements:
-->
</p>
<program language="java"><input>
    HelloWorld helloworld;          // Variable declaration
    helloworld = new HelloWorld();  // Object instantiation
    helloworld.greet();             // Method invocation
</input></program>
<p>
      The first statement declares a variable of type <c>HelloWorld</c>, which is then assigned a <c>HelloWorld</c> object.
</p>
<p>
      The second statement creates a <c>HelloWorld</c> object by
      invoking <c>HelloWorld</c>'s default constructor: <c>HelloWorld()</c>.
      A default constructor has the same name as the class and merely creates
      an object of that class. It is defined automatically by Java 
      and looks like this:
</p>
<program language="java"><input>
     public HelloWorld() {  }  // Default constructor
</input></program>
<p>  
      Creating an object is called <term>object instantiation</term>
      because you are creating an instance of the object.
      Once a <c>HelloWorld</c> instance is created,
      we can use one of its instance methods to perform some task or operation.
</p>
<p>
      Thus, in the third statement,
      we call the <c>greet()</c> method,
      which will print
<q>Hello World!</q>
      on the console.
</p>

<p>
      The <c>HelloWorld</c> program (<xref ref="lstng_helloworld"></xref>)illustrates the idea that an 
      object-oriented program is a collection of interacting objects.
      Although we create just a single <c>HelloWorld</c> object in the <c>main()</c> method,
      there are two other objects used in the program.
      One is the <c>greeting</c> object, the <q>Hello, World!</q>
<c>String</c>. 
      The other is the <c>System.out</c> object,
      which is a special Java system object used for printing.
